iSketchbook is a handmade open source [WinterBoard](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/WinterBoard) concept/theme.  
The process of making the icons was:

- Printing the grid of rounded boxes on a A4 paper [template.doc](/template.doc)
- Drawing the icons using a blue ink pen.
- Scanning the papers and cropping the icons to their respective PSDs. [Icon@2x.psd](/PSDs/Icon@2x.psd)/[SBSettings-Toggle.psd](/PSDs/SBSettings-Toggle.psd)
- PNGCrushing the files to remove unused channels/critical chunk in order to save RAM (tough times, 256mb)

The other assets have varied from ripping papers, smashing, dripping coffee, and many other tests that may have or may have not failed.

## Support

iSketchbook works on `iOS 4.3.5` and partially on `iOS 5.1.1` (as apple have moved/renamed some of the assets).
This theme also supports (fully or not) the following Cydia Apps (besides WinterBoard itself):
- SnowCover4
- ColorKeyboard
- FontSwap
- BytaFont
- SBSettings

## Font

The font included was optimized to work on the iDevices, it's name is Daniel, and you can grab a copy [here](http://www.dafont.com/pt/daniel.font) if you want to - as it's totally free.
