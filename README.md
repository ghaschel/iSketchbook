iSketchbook is a handmade open source [WinterBoard](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/WinterBoard) concept/theme.
The process of making the icons was:
- Printing the grid of rounded boxes on a A4 paper
 - [template.doc](/tempalte.doc)
- Drawing the icons inside of the boxes using a blue ink pen.
- Scanning the papers and cropping the icons to their respective PSDs.
 - [Icon@2x.psd](/PSDs/Icon@2x.psd)
 - [SBSettings-Toggle.psd](/PSDs/SBSettings-Toggle.psd)

The other assets have varied from ripping paper, smashing, dripping coffee, and many other tests that may have or not failed.

## Support

iSketchbook works on `iOS 4.3.5` and partially on `iOS 5.1.1` (as apple have moved/renamed some of the assets).
This theme also supports (fully or not) the following Cydia Apps (besides WinterBoard itself):
- SnowCover4
- ColorKeyboard
- FontSwap
- BytaFont
- SBSettings

## Font

The font included was optimized to work on the iDevices, it's name is Daniel, and you can grab a copy [here](http://www.dafont.com/pt/daniel.font) - as it's totally free.
